# How the plot was made
The process Is a bit complex:\
1 First using Muslim notebook religion by constituency was transformed to arrive at Muslim% by constituency\
2 Then we used Cnadidates notebook to transform the HoC results table to a table with voteshares of only 'Gaza issue parties'\
3 Finally the two transformed csv's were plotted using correlation notebook
